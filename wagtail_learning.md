# Wagtail Learning

Here is a list of the things I need to remember when starting off

# Models

## Core wagtail packages:

```python
from django.db import models
```

### Code

```python
from wagtail.core.models import Page
```

### Admin

```python
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel, PageChooserPanel
from wagtail.images.edit_handlers import ImageChooserPanel
```

---

## Making a page class (boiler plate)

```python
class HomePage(Page):
    lead_text = models.CharField(
        max_length=100,
        blank=False,  # whether you're allowed to not have an image
        null=True,  # whether it can be null in the database
        help_text="Lead text help")
```

### Content panels

Used to edit fields via the admin page

```python
    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel("foo_text"),
        PageChooserPanel("foo_button"),
        ImageChooserPanel("foo_image"),
    ]
```

### get_context

```python
    def get_context(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context(request, *args, **kwargs)
        hello_world = "hello world 123"
        context['hello_world'] = hello_world
        return context
```

### Quick notes

-   images are Foreign keys:

```python
class FooPage(Page):
    foo_image = models.ForeignKey(
        'wagtailimages.Image',
        blank=False,  # you MUST have an image
        null=True,  # can be nothing in the Database
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        help_text='This image will be used on the Service Listing Page',
        related_name='+',
    )
```

## DJANGO BLOCK RECURSION

-   "main" imported "navbar"
-   "navbar" was wrapped in a block tag
-   import statement in "main" wasn't
-   caused a recursion error
-   lol

Then bought the "build blog with wagtail" book
Prettier isn't working on Python files
Have now installed Black and have replaced that as the default.

Add "related pages" at bottom of page:

> In my opinion itâ€™s a better user experience to present a link to a relevant article than to send a user to a page of links. - https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-john-mueller-tags-seo/396114/#close
